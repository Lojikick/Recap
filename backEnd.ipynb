How are they designed?**\\n> \\n> I was talking to an alum who graduated in the early 2000s, and he was talking about being a good software engineer vs. computer scientist.\\n> \\n> I don't fully understand the distinction between the two. Can someone explain it, and what the school classes are geared towards?\\n> \\n> What are the professors' expectations when teaching? Do they simply want us to become better at the topic, or do they want us to become a better X through taking courses Y and Z?\\n> \\n> What does the school want us to become/earn after we graduate besides the degree itself?\\n\\n## **Anant Sahai's Answer**\\n\\n[EECS Professor Anant Sahai](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sahai.html) replied:\\n\\n> The point of the classes that EECS offers is to, collectively, help you become a better engineer (and scholar, should you go on for graduate study) over the course of a 40+ year career. Ideally, a Berkeley style engineer who can work on things that push the boundaries and not just filling in the blanks.  Engineers who can contribute to make society better and advancing the state of knowledge, while learning. How classes do this is by helping you think about things more clearly. When I was an undergraduate, there were things said in lecture that were never on an exam or a HW that still ended up helping me years later. If a student thinks that a class is about doing well on the homework or on exams or getting a good grade, the student is missing the point. If the student thinks the point of the course is to teach them a particular tool that they can use in industry, they are also missing the point. They should be paying attention and trying to internalize how we are thinking.\\n> \\n> A Bachelor's degree is meant to prepare you for being an apprentice --- to learn productively from masters who are working in the field. There are going to be many practical skills associated with both software engineering in general as well as particular application domains that you will have to learn in the field. In general, the time at Berkeley is precious and what you could learn better in industry should be left to be taught to you there. Details (and particular tools) are easy to learn in industry, but big pictures are harder. This is because real life has lots of details. Knowing how to remove the details and see the essence is the skill that is hard to learn in industry precisely because the essence alone is never enough. But the essence is critical for making strategic decisions. However, when people start out, they don't usually get to make strategic decisions. So there is a gap --- a time during which you are learning a lot in industry and not seeing the full advantage of your Berkeley education. This is fine from our point of view --- we are teaching you with the time-scale of decades in our mind.\\n\\n## **EECS Adviser's Answer**\\n\\n> [guide.berkeley.edu](http://guide.berkeley.edu/) maintains student learning goals for every major on campus\\n\\n## **Other discussion**\\n\\nA former TA wrote:\\n\\n> I think Prof. Sahai's answer is a really good high-level answer.\\n> \\n> Most of these questions also don't have specific answers -- I don't believe the CS department has specific goals for graduates other than that they are successful. But two obvious goals are the UCB CS graduates should be competitive candidates for top engineering jobs and graduate schools. However, the path to graduate school is not necessarily the same as the path to the software industry (that really depends on a lot of factors). Ideally, students should feel comfortable pursuing their dreams. (Which is admittedly cheesy, but I believe accurately so).\\n> \\n> Courses at Berkeley are numbered in various buckets, most coarsely: Lower division, Upper Division, Graduate Level. (0XX, 1XX, 2XX, respectively.) Within the increasing buckets you're expected to go from breadth to increasing depth on a topic.  \\n>  \\n> What I would also add, is that every (faculty member, course, semester) combination is unique in some respects. Each course (i.e. CS161) has a syllabus that's approved by campus that covers the basic concepts that are expected to be covered, but each offering may adapt as course staff want to try different approaches or make adjusts for what may be changing goals. So, if you're curious about a particular course--just ask! Faculty (typically) love waxing poetic about their course designs and aspirations for their courses. It's no easy task, and it's always nice to hear from interested students. \\n> \\n> Finally, I want to caution you (or anyone), that your personal learning and a life goals may not match up with those of a particular course. I took plenty of courses during my time as a student where my goals were somewhat different than the courses. In those cases I focused most strongly on the aspects that aligned well, and learned what I could from the other stuff. For smaller courses or project based ones, I made sure to take any flexibility I had, and adapt it to my interests. For example in non-CS courses I would explore problems by using small programs and data to make an argument. Naturally, writing code to finish a writing reading response isn't necessary (or something I recommend for everyone), but at the time it was a fun way to be personally and academically productive, and whenever I've done things like professors are almost always receptive.\\n\\nA student replied:\\n\\n> I was interested in your comment that you wrote code to write a reading response for you. Am I understanding this correctly? You wrote a program to write an essay for one of your classes. How did you do this project?\\n\\nThe TA replied:\\n\\n> I didn't mean to imply a wrote a program that could generate english. That would probably be beyond my abilities (at least, if I wanted it to be coherent....). The course was History of Information (a great course overall!), and we were talking about the effects of the dictionary on the development of language and how that affected word choice. I was in 61A at the time, and we had just learned to use dictionaries (the Python kind, of course) and so I though it would be fun to do things like word count on a couple texts we were given as well as some basic statistics and to find data to explore the same topics. It was nothing super rigorous, but I found it to be a good way to practice Python  (of which I needed lots of practice them!) and to explore the topic in a way that I figured most people would not. Based on what I learned from messing around I used that to write the reading response which gave me a bit more depth and thus made the word count thing easier. :) I mean, I can BS my way to a word count any day [hello AP courses!] but assignments are much more fun when you can complete them without needing to do that.\",\n",
       " 'EECS 101 Piazza post: [https://piazza.com/class/hyq0br1u3kx7dg?cid=3587](https://piazza.com/class/hyq0br1u3kx7dg?cid=3587)\\n\\n## **Student\\'s Piazza post**\\n\\n> **Questioning the EE 16A Requirement for L&S CS**\\n> \\n> Why do L&S CS majors have to take EE16A?\\n> \\n> I\\'m currently enrolled in this class and I see little use for 2/3 of this class (i.e. anything outside of linear algebra) for a majority of L&S CS majors who will most likely not deal with circuits in their futures.\\n> \\n> I have heard the following opinions on why this is the case and provided a series of counter points to them:\\n> \\n> 1) EE16A and EE 16B prepare students for other CS courses, specifically CS 70\\n> \\n> A broad majority of L&S CS majors don\\'t end up taking EE 16A nor EE 16B before they are able to declare, since it would be useless to most of them if they weren\\'t able to get into the major. Therefore, since CS 70 is part of our declaration requirement, we anyways end up taking it before EE 16A and EE 16B, which makes it useless. In regards to prepping us for other courses, a majority of CS upper division courses either don\\'t require any knowledge of circuits or require a knowledge of circuits that runs tangential to the course material. This can be seen from the fact that 16a and 16b are very sparsely, if at all, listed as prerequisites to any CS upper division course.\\n> \\n> 2) A basic amount of knowledge of circuits is essential to a proper CS education.\\nI disagree with this entirely. There definitely do exist fields within CS for which a knowledge of circuits would be useful but there also exists numerous fields in CS (esp. with industrial application) that require absolutely no knowledge of circuits. And if this is the case, it seems that imposing a requirement that ALL students must know a basic amount of knowledge on circuits would be unfair to those who have no need to use it in the future. This is the same point that I would make as to why CS 170 and CS 162 are not required for all CS majors, even though they are extremely useful in a large proportion of fields within CS.\\n> \\n> 3) EE 16A gives students a better understanding of linear algebra that Math 54 that would be essential for CS majors when taking classes in the future\\n> \\n> If this is a concern, students should be offered the option of taking Math 54 + Math 110 instead of Math 54 + EE 16A since Math 110 also imposes a higher understanding of linear algebra.\\n> \\n> I argue that EE 16A should either be entirely removed as a L&S CS major requirement or, as mentioned in my last point, should be replaced/substitutable with Math 110.\\n> \\n> I would love to hear any followup discussions regarding this topic; my goal in posting this is to spark a discussion on why exactly we have this requirement for L&S CS majors and hopefully either get it removed for future L&S CS majors or hear a solid explanation as to why EE 16A needs to be a requirement for all L&S CS majors as opposed to an optional class that L&S CS majors could take if their academic interests align with material taught in the class.\\n\\n## **Anant Sahai\\'s initial answer**\\n\\n[EECS Professor Anant Sahai](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sahai.html) replied:\\n\\n> Hi, I will write a more detailed answer later but first will say that I encourage you to come and talk to me to understand this better. 16AB were designed to be fundamental to the needs of all of our students in preparation for a 40-year career going forward, and L&S CS students in particular. We in the faculty have a bit more experience than you do about both how fields are evolving intellectually as well as just how much things can change with time. As a student, you don\\'t really understand the bigger picture, especially the scope of change and the need for a robust development of different ways of thinking. Which is to be expected --- otherwise, you wouldn\\'t need the university and could just go and read books and do projects on your own to learn. The answer so far (I have to go to a meeting) is basically of the \"trust us\" variety, and there is a strong case that such trust is actually fundamental to the student/teacher relationship. Everything we say will always have a dimension of \"trust us\" to it, because you do not understand or appreciate what you cannot yet fathom. In the words of Donald Rumsfeld, it\\'s the unknown unknowns that get you.  One of our goals is to make you more ready for them.\\n\\n## **Student\\'s answer**\\n\\nA student wrote:\\n\\n> If I were to follow your logic, I would argue that R&C/Breadth/HSS/AC requirements should be entirely removed from all science and engineering majors as those would have no impact nor benefit on the career of a computer scientist/engineer.\\n\\n## **OP\\'s response to student\\'s answer and Sahai\\'s initial answer**\\n\\nThe OP wrote:\\n\\n> OP here. I disagree with the first student response. Breadths make sense because all L&S majors are fundamentally part of a liberal arts school, which stresses a fundamental understanding of a variety of subjects that don\\'t relate to our traditional technical curriculum. So that requirement makes sense because that\\'s the fundamental teaching philosophy behind the entire school; this is why breadths reqs. vary between schools. On the other hand, EE 16a is a major requirement, which means it should (in principle) relate to our specific technical curriculum.\\n> \\n> Prof. Sahai: I appreciate your quick response! I\\'d love to hear your more detailed answer and maybe follow up in person if necessary, but I just want to point out that my post doesn\\'t come from a point of conceit but rather from a point of relative frustration. That is, I agree entirely that professors would have a much more thorough understanding of the fields and understand what is and isn\\'t useful to teach us, but often times it may be frustrating from a student\\'s perspective if we\\'re told to learn something that seems tangential to everything else we learn when we don\\'t have an understanding of the bigger picture in mind. I especially see this a lot with 16A since there are many CS majors (myself included) who find it frustrating that we have to learn about circuits. Maybe some of your detailed perspectives on this issue may resolve our concerns! Looking forward to hearing your response.\\n\\n## **Sahai\\'s response to OP**\\n\\nSahai responded:\\n\\n> Very coarsely speaking, there are three major ways that information is processed and information processing is itself understood, and their relative importance changes with time and application. \\n> \\n> 1) Procedure-orientation: this is the standard Turing/Von-Neumann \"computation\" approach that is represented by most programming languages used today. \\n> \\n> 2) Circuit-orientation: this is what is behind the operation of neural networks as well as analog circuitry. \\n> \\n> 3) Optimization-orientation: these are where minimalist principles and constraints are important. Many databases also fall into this category.\\n> \\n> It is absolutely vital for a CS student to know and be comfortable with reasoning about all three modes. The 61ABC series is heavily weighted towards (1) with a little bit of (3) mixed in during 61A.  16AB bring more of (2) and (3) into the mix, and it is vital that this happen as early as possible in students\\' development so that their mental muscles are more balanced in their development. This is why we absolutely urge 16AB to be taken by freshmen. \\n> \\n> Within (2), there are many aspects to analog information processing. In 16A you see a little bit as well as how it connects via constraints to optimization-oriented thinking. However, in 16B the dynamic aspects also come into play. While today\\'s deep neural networks tend to use circuits for information processing (circuits emulated by programs running SIMD cores for now, but more specialized cores in the future) in a way that doesn\\'t involve time, there is every indication that biological neural networks do indeed invoke time dynamics in nontrivial ways. So it would be absolutely irresponsible of us to not give students some inclination of time-dynamic behavior of circuits as a part of their foundational training for a 40 year career. This is why the department wants everyone taking 16A and 16B.\\n> \\n> Fundamentally, EECS has two pillars: information and computation. All students need grounding in both even if they may choose to specialize in one more than the other. But they need to start with mental balance to the extent possible so that they don\\'t misunderstand informational issues as being computational nor vice-versa. You\\'re going to have to learn and adapt. It\\'s our job to give you the foundation so that you can do so.\\n\\n## **Elad Alon\\'s reply to OP**\\n\\n I think that Anant largely hit the points that I would have made, but I\\'d like to also offer to speak with anyone in person about why I believe the material in EE16A and EE16B are indeed fundamental to your education as a CS student.\\n\\n> To follow up on one specific aspect that Anant hinted at however, if you look at where the major innovations/advancements have happened in the last decade (starting arbitrarily from e.g. the iPhons), almost all of them have involved optimization and co-design among multiple levels of the system stack (from applications and algorithms all the way down to the circuits and devices).  Even if you end up as a purely \"software\" engineer, our goal at Berkeley is to try train you to be one of the ninjas who has at least a basic understanding of how issues at layers both above and below where you work can not only influence what you are doing, but provide opportunities for optimization of the system as a whole.\\n> \\n> Another point I\\'d like to make is that many of the skills you exercise in circuit design are actually essentially identical to skills you would exercise in software or system design as a whole (as well in linear algebra).  I can dive in to the details if you\\'d like, but debugging, modularity, modeling, and using structured methods to do design and even analysis are all common across the board.  As a final note, there are actually many mathematical concepts underlying circuits, and gaining intuition about those same concepts but with physical quantities you may not be as familiar with is a great way to make sure you really understand the math.\\n\\n## **Student\\'s reply**\\n\\nA student wrote:\\n\\n> In my honest opinion, I agree with Sahai about EE 16B being a vital introduction to electrical engineering, but from what I know, EE 16A just doesn\\'t have the same quality, and seems more like a mishmash of linear algebra (which is mostly covered in Math 54), and circuitry (which is already somewhat, if not mostly, covered in Physics 7B). I propose the following as an alternative setup:\\n> \\n> Introducing a CS 70-Math 55 (as in \"Linear Algebra with Emphasis in Theory and Applications in Computation\") analogue for Math 54, carrying over all the properties of the relationship between CS 70 and Math 55 (e.g. acceptability for Math/CS double major, major requirement for CS and EECS, etc.), replacing the Physics 7B major requirement for EECS with a new \"Electromagnetism and its Applications for Computation\" class required for both L&S and EECS graduation, which will in teach op-amps and the remainder of circuitry in 16A not already covered in lieu of most (or all) of the thermodynamics unit, phasing out EE 16A, and keeping EE 16B as is.\\n> \\n> In this scenario, the unit requirement for EECS students will drop, and that of L&S CS students will stay the same (as they are not required to take Physics currently, resulting in the new E&M class replacing the units vacated by 16A).\\n> \\n> The only drawback I see in this arrangement is the possible slight increase in faculty for the [EE]CS department, but I think the benefit of reducing and/or streamlining the courseload would outweigh this cost.\\n\\n## **Elad Alon\\'s reply**\\n\\nElad Alon wrote:\\n\\n> I do appreciate your concrete suggestion and for starting a constructive dialog - I hope that my following comments/discussion will be read in that spirit as well.  \\n> \\n> I have to admit that I\\'m somewhat puzzled by your comments regarding the content/structure of 16A (especially relative to the recent offerings), but it\\'s probably not worth dwelling on that.  More importantly, there are a number of additional (in my opinion substabtial) issues with your proposal, one of the most important of which (again, in my opinion) is that this approach will explicitly de-emphasize that designing efficient systems involves optimizing (and hence understanding) across multiple (all) layers of hierarchy simultaneously, and that often times, things you do at one level can make your life dramatically simpler (or harder) at the others.  The silo\\'ed approach you are proposing is exactly what I have seen over and over in my career (both in academic and industrial contexts) lead people down highly sub-optimal approaches to solving the problems that faced them.  For almost all intents and purposes, this would go back to the 20/40 model we had before (although granted it would be a very different version of 20), which was very clearly not working (both overall and specifically in highlighting the above).\\n> \\n> As I tried to describe in my response above, learning about how to design circuits - and especially the way we present that in 16 - is really not some fundamentally different beast than learning how to apply mathematical techniques to solve problems in other domains (such as machine learning, robotics, medical systems, ...).  Making this intellectual link clear throughout all of the modules (in 16A and 16B) is something we are constantly striving to improve, but splitting the content up (as you proposed) in to separate courses certainly won\\'t help with this.\\n> \\n> Also, as a fully practical matter, 16B (which follows the same integrated approach described in the first paragraph) really wouldn\\'t work in the general case for the target audience without the build-up and introduction (both in terms of content as well as way of thinking) from 16A.  While we are allowing L&S students moving forward (for now) to fullfil their requirements with Math 54 and 16B (mostly for reasons that I hope will be transient, as I\\'ll explain below), that is not the path we recommend by any means, and is not something that would work in general without the existence of 16A.\\n> \\n> To clarify the above and address an indirect point I believe you are raising, we are currently in discussions with both Math and Statistics about getting them to accept the combination of 16A+B as replacements for Math 54 (both in terms of course prereqs as well as for their majors).  This is by no means a done deal and we can\\'t yet make any guarantees, but my hope is that this will address some of the practical issues that are driving some students to delay taking 16 (which again, I definitely don\\'t recommend).\\n\\n## **Student\\'s reply**\\n\\nA student replied:\\n\\n> So to clarify, you believe it is absolutely important and necessary to include Linear Algebra in any incarnation of an introductory EE course?\\n> \\n> Also, to discuss your middle two paragraphs, I believe it is possible to teach circuitry in your integrated fashion while still including (at least basic) material on electric and magnetic fields and forces as taught in Physics 7B. In fact, I think this will extend the integration to one more level, in the sense of understanding how the different electrical components work under the hood (in terms of how they move electrons and affect electromagnetic fields).\\n\\n## **Anant Sahai\\'s response**\\n\\nAnant Sahai wrote:\\n\\n> Please come and talk with me about any concerns that you have about 16A. It is meant to be taken by freshmen in their first semester in parallel with 61A. That is firmly the intended audience and recommended scheduling by students, and the course is designed for that. Clearing the backlog of students during the transition who have not taken it as freshmen creates some degrees of mismatch here and there, but it is our goal that even those students should get a lot out of taking 16A. (I\\'ll be honest, when I taught it, both me and my TAs got a lot out of it. And we all supposedly know all this stuff perfectly by comparison --- so it should reward contemplation for pretty much everyone.) \\n> \\n> Our goals for 16A are to asymptotically achieve perfection in the course --- and this means that we welcome any and all bug reports. Send me an email. The goal is that the course should be fundamentally inclusive and that every single concept taught in the course should be clear, integrated, and obviously relevant. Just like students, we Profs will fall short of the high goals that we set for ourselves, but that doesn\\'t mean that we stop trying. :-)\\n> \\n> In terms of linear algebra, yes, we believe that linear algebra is absolutely fundamental to EECS and that students need to learn *why* things are defined the way they are and to really understand the connections between these fundamental concepts. This isn\\'t about symbol pushing or some calculating tricks. \\n\\n## **Elad Alon\\'s reply**\\n\\nElad Alon wrote:\\n\\n> Responding to both of your follow-ups here, approximately in order, although in many ways your questions/comments are related.  \\n> \\n> Would I argue that any possible introduction to EE must by definition include linear algebra?  No, certainly not - this wasn\\'t the way I learned things originally, and this isn\\'t how things are taught in most other schools (at least not yet).  That\\'s a pretty weak criteria though - as a student, I distinctly remember wondering to myself why in the world I was learning the things that I was (especially in my intro circuits class, but even well after that), and I perservered despite that.\\n> \\n> This leads to one of the main reasons I would however argue that including linear algebra in an intro EE(CS) class is absolutely important - and perhaps even almost necessary.  Including linear algebra allows us to show with relatively little prior background just how powerful the tools and techniques that underly modern EE (and CS) really are in enabling real-world applications that students (particularly freshman) will not only recognize, but have a visceral feeling about/interest in.  I really can\\'t take the credit for that particular realization BTW - it was really much more the product of Gireeja Ranade\\'s and Anant\\'s thinking than my own (at the time) - but having now worked this through (along with the two of them and many others), linear algebra really is the one conceptual area I can think of that finds substantial importance and use across pretty much the entire spectrum of EE endeavors (including the more physicsy side, as you mentioned).  As already mentioned, it is also something that can be taught to students coming out of high school (of course with appropriate math maturity) while simultaneously exposing them to the application (and hence making them feel \"empowered\").  \\n> \\n> I certainly agree with you that an integrated approach to teaching physics 7B like material would be extremely worthwhile as well.  Physics 7B itself however requires more math background than what can be expected from incoming freshman, and so this is one of the reasons why we made the choice to partition things the way we did.  (Another reason for this is that for better or for worse, in general, students entering from high school tend to have less background in or opportunities to learn physics than they do math.) \\n> \\n> I\\'m now dipping into a much more highly speculative topic, but to follow up a bit further on your point about an integrated approach to Physics 7B, there have actually been some discussions amongst the faculty about creating a \"16C\" (naming along with everything else TBD) that could serve as an alternative option for Physics 7B.  This (currently hypothetical) course would more directly expose students to the applications/motivations for the 7B material, as well as more generally the \"physicy\" side of EECS.  This class could then also leverage the linear algebra (as well as of course circuits and basic sensor ideas) from 16A/B.  In case it wasn\\'t obvious from how I started this paragraph, it isn\\'t at all yet clear when or even if this will happen - the discussions are still highly preliminary.  Based on my experience from 16A/B, standing up a course like this will take (tens of) thousands of hours of work, and so it\\'s not a task that anyone will be taking on lightly.  I do believe it\\'s an exciting possibility however, and am doing what I can to help support this eventually happening (but again, absolutely no guarantees at all at this time).\\n> \\n> I guess that Anant\\'s and my responses crossed each other, but fortunately, (I think :) we emphasized the same fundamental idea (about the importance of linear algebra) while covering some other orthogonal points.  Just to re-emphasize though, I have no doubt that there are things that can be improved in both 16A and 16B, so I\\'d like to make the same offer as Anant did.  If something doesn\\'t seem to be working in either of those classes, please feel free to email me as well - a huge amount of thinking and work has gone in to these courses, but that doesn\\'t mean that there aren\\'t still improvements to be made.  Constructive feedback is hence always highly welcomed.',\n",
       " '[Professor Anant Sahai](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sahai/) is teaching [CS70 Spring 2014](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70/sp14/).\\n\\nSahai as a high school senior: http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-20/local/me-599_1_state-academic-decathlon\\n\\nA student asked on the classroom forum Piazza:\\n\\n> **Sahai -- what are your daily rituals?**\\n\\n> From the very beginning of the semester you\\'ve stressed the importance of time management and many times have both implicitly and explicitly stated that after eating and sleeping we should be working.\\n\\n> For a source of inspiration, would you mind sharing what an average day of being Prof. Sahai is like? I\\'m sure me and many others would find it interesting.\\n\\n\\n> EDIT: Or maybe even a college version in the past when you were a student vs nowadays, if you\\'re so inclined.\\n\\nProfessor Anant Sahai replied:\\n\\n> College Anant Sahai:\\n\\n> I didn\\'t keep detailed records of my time, so this is from unreliable memory.\\n\\n> Took a nap pretty much every day. Aaah Foothill La Loma dorms --- so close for naptime. (I moved into Foothill the first fall it opened.)  And the lounge space around Sibley Auditorium --- perfect for napping. Later I lived essentially across the street from Tolman --- also close enough for napping.\\n\\n> At the beginning, called home every single day. I missed my brother tremendously. Also wrote paper letters to folks back home --- long-distance phone calls were expensive! And there was no widespread email.\\n\\n> Lived freshman year in Clark Kerr in a suite. The building was rather antisocial back then, and my suite was close to the entrance. So me and my suitemates would order a pizza every night (I hit my lifetime quota of Fat Slice in about a semester and a half) and prop the door open. It was a salon of sorts --- late night pizza, random philosophical conversations, and playing some cards. (The Monty Hall Puzzle came into it when it was sweeping the country. Main card games: speed and 24.) People paid their share of the pizza, but my suitemates and I put in the effort to make this happen. Lots of discussions in the evening about the material we were learning in courses, life, religion, philosophy, and political speculation. That kept happening throughout undergrad. We also played a rather grotesque variant of 20 questions in which you had to guess how someone died and why. \\n\\n> Took Math H50A (the then equivalent of Math H54) and H50B (the then equivalent of Math H53) as a freshman. Immensely challenging homeworks that really made you learn the material. It was also amusing to watch a class start with 50-some students and end the year with just 5 of us. Great fun. I learned everything in Math 110 as well as the usual 53/54 content, as well as a chunk of Math 128. This is the course that, more than any other single course, impressed upon me what Berkeley was really about. Why this is the greatest University on this planet. Oh by the way, H50AB was taught at the time by a faculty member who was joint Math and EECS. (He is now retired.) \\n\\n> Took Physics H7ABC. Also great fun. Loved the hard homeworks and fun exams. Enjoyed hearing stories from older Physics faculty reminiscing about the Manhattan Project. Had entered Berkeley unsure about EECS vs Math vs Physics. Seriously considered Physics before realizing that EECS really had the theoretical depth that I wanted.\\n\\n> Spent many hours on the Math and Physics problem sets. And enjoyed every bit of it. Had study group sessions with others in the course. In general, throughout undergrad, I learned a lot by helping others. It really is the best way to understand something.\\n\\n> Enjoyed 60ABC (the names then for 61ACB) a lot. Made it a ritual along with his friends to climb to the roof of Pimental before any midterm or exam and dance around. (DO NOT DO THIS.) Found these courses mostly quite easy --- although 60C with Prof. Hilfinger took some time and was great fun. (As was 60A with Stuart Russell and 60B with John Ousterhout, both fun but not very time consuming.) \\n\\n> Attended a great mini-course by CSUA and XCF on advanced Emacs Lisp. With his best friend (who he met in H50A and H7A, took most classes with and who came with him to MIT for grad school), wrote an emacs lisp program to help automate playing DikuMUD (a text-based multiplayer role-playing game).  Fun. We did this in the evenings of freshman year first semester while taking 60A.\\n\\n> Used to watch Anime every monday evening at the Cal Anime club. (With that same best friend above --- who used to take Japanese courses.) \\n\\n> Spent countless hours in the Eta Kappa Nu office just chatting with people and tutoring folks. And learning by osmosis. You\\'d be surprised what all you can pick up just by watching people tutor others in upper-division courses! I believe my friend and I might have been the founding compserv officers and we were one of the originators of the \"challenges\" tradition that candidates have to do. \\n\\n> I ate food in the dorms at meal times my freshman and sophomore years. After that, I moved into an apartment when my brother also came to Berkeley. Then I used to enjoy cooking. \\n\\n> I tried to sleep a good amount every night, and following my parents general rules, no studying the night before an exam or in the near vicinity of an exam. I could help others though --- so final time was always great fun. Lots of spare time to enjoy myself! Dead week started later while I was a student.\\n\\n> Never took an American Cultures course --- that requirement started after I had joined. My brother took it though, so I learned a lot of the material in the linguistics one indirectly. \\n\\n> Took lots of Math courses: I think 104, 113, 185, and 125. \\n\\n> This was before 70 and 126. So I took Math 55 and Stat 134. It was before 127 so I took an IEOR optimization course. \\n\\n> The classes that kept me up late: EECS 192 (I believe I was in the inaugural class for that), 150 (It was a big class then. In my year, the project was essentially a trick. If you tried to solve it directly, you were doomed. My group [with my best friend again] and a group of grad students were the only ones who finished the project. Both of us realized that it was easier to solve a harder problem --- design and make our own computer, write our own compiler for it, and then write a computer program to solve the given project.), and a special Engineering course that taught us everything you needed to know to start a company. (This was before the dot com boom.) We proposed a company to deal differently with email that we had called SpectralMail. One of my cofounders (also one of my best friends and fellow HKN officer) went on to found HotOrNot while a Berkeley PhD student. Another has also had a bunch of startups. \\n\\n> I took 221A and 222 as an undergrad. That was fun. Grad courses were a lot more work. And intense. No real study group though because I was the only undergrad in the course. \\n\\n> Spent my summers at research internships. Back then, Berkeley had a formal internship program for top EECS undergrads. Lots of places like Xerox PARC and HP Labs and so on would only take undergrad interns from MIT and Berkeley. Grad students only from any other place --- which made sense I guess given how our curriculum is so out of everyone else\\'s league. \\n\\n> Anyway, for the most part, I always made sure to eat, sleep (including daily naps), and have fun. It was a lot easier to be focused on study-relevant fun in the days before Facebook, laptop computers, mobile phones, and the world-wide-web.  As far as I can tell, the only really good thing that has come from the internet age for education is Wikipedia. Not sure if the others actually help anyone learn anything better given the amount of time they suck up. Computers are nice, I guess. But even back then we had things like Mathematica and programming environments. So, we could explore things on our own even before the Internet. \\n\\n> EDIT TO ADD: Forgot to mention that I was on the Berkeley ACM Programming contest team. My year, we didn\\'t do so well. When my brother was on the team, we won the International competition. Best in the world.\\n\\nA student asked:\\n\\n> Have you ever bombed an exam, or had moments where you felt you couldn\\'t keep up with all your classes?\\n\\nSahai replied:\\n\\n> Unfortunately, I never really had those kinds of feelings personally, at least not in a way that is real --- in that I felt bad because I really did do badly. But I did have close friends who felt that way so I have some empathic experience with them. I know that it can be hard to walk out of high school a star and then find yourself in the middle of the pack here in Berkeley. I\\'ve seen enough tears from my fellow students when I was a student, and tears from my students as a faculty member.\\n\\nAnother student asked:\\n\\n> I\\'m asking these questions because I was thinking a lot about it and I\\'d like to see your input about it, prof. Sahai:\\n\\n> 1. question: Have you ever felt that you are missing out on life\\'s opportunities (say, backpack through Cambodia for 6 months or move to another country) by basically sacrificing everything to Mathematics or science? Not to say that they aren\\'t worth sacrificing for, but to me this seems to be a curse for talented people (which makes me happy that I\\'m a mere mortal)...\\n\\n> 2. question: How do you perceive brain drain? While you yourself were raised in California, I believe you (and advisors in general) are very influential in the development of (graduate) students, many of whom are international.. And I have noticed on your website that basically all your students stayed in the US. Is brain drain just a necessary evil on our path to evolving towards a global community or is it a real issue that should be counteracted?\\n\\nSahai replied:\\n\\n> These are easy to answer:\\n\\n> 1) No. Serving learning is a wonderful calling, and it is no sacrifice to spend time and effort on what you truly love. Are there tradeoffs? Yes, but they\\'re due to the nature of time and space, not learning. Is the world perfect? No! But when people say that academia and learning will break your heart, they aren\\'t referring to the nature of Math, Science, and Engineering. They are referring to the flaws in an economic/political system that blocks talented people from doing work they love that also truly needs to be done while helping humanity, just because they have to eat and take care of their families and the powers that be refuse to let them do so.\\n\\n> 2) As an American, I like things that help the people of the United States. Having smart people coming here and staying to contribute, well that just makes good sense. Does it hurt other countries and other populations? Not really. If the other country wants to support them, they are free to do so. Most people would gladly return to their home region to contribute there. Look at Europe. Lots of people go back there. But I have seen far too many cases of places that basically refuse to do this. They know what needs to be done (give people freedom and create decent paying jobs with autonomy) and refuse to do it. Because in most cases, the local powers that be want to keep the rich and powerful rich and powerful. So, a person doing research in the USA is actually doing more for the people of their home country than that person would be doing back home.\\n\\n> Lots of people contribute charitably back to their countries of origin --- and many I hope also contribute to help support the kinds of reformist and revolutionary organizations/social-movements that are needed to actually make real change happen.  (I\\'m not saying that the powers that be have any better motivations in the USA --- hierarchical power is inherently corrupting. It is just that social movements in the USA have, in the past, helped tame those forces at least a bit.) It is the will of the people and the blood, sweat, and tears of activists that matter. They made a better life for people and the ones active today are planting the trees that future generations will enjoy.']"
